<p>I have many interests, and they are constantly shifting in priority. This is just a snapshot of a top few things at the moment.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-web-services:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae">Amazon Web Services</h4>

<p>The rate at which AWS rolls out new services and iterates on existing ones boggles the mind. The Gateway API, Lambda and DynamoDB hold my gaze currently.</p>

<h4 id="client-side-development:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae">Client-side development</h4>

<p>Web Components, Polymer, Angular 2, TypeScript, Dart, React&hellip; the area of client-side technology is absolutely crazy right now. It&rsquo;s fascinating and frustrating. Targets, libraries, frameworks are all moving so fast. Trying to pick your horse to get you through the next year or so is a task that will make your head spin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been bouncing all over the place with the above technology, trying to decide what I should build my next round of side projects on. I&rsquo;m liking the direction of Web Components, and am favoring tools and frameworks that are either working to implement what the standard looks like, or look like what the standard looks like.</p>

<h4 id="offline-first-nobackend:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae">Offline-first / #nobackend</h4>

<p>Combining the previous two interests, I want to delve deeper into building client-side apps that go through the AWS Gateway API, through to AWS Lambda and Dynamo DB.</p>

<h4 id="statistics:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae">Statistics</h4>

<p>Apache Spark looks super cool. R is awesome. Putting them together looks like it could be a powerful combination.</p>
