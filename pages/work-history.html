<div class="section" id="jama-software-senior-software-developer">
<h3>Jama Software - Senior Software Developer</h3>
<p><em>Apr 2012 - Oct 2013 · 1 yr 7 mos</em></p>
<p>At Jama, I was recruited to come join a new, small team that was building out the next generation of the company's products. We were a team of four, working independently from the rest of the development organization, doing rapid prototyping and experimentation. Our work was eventually folded back into the core product, which led to new challenges of merging multiple server- and client-side architectures into the same product.</p>
<p>Technologies: Java, Jersey RESTful services, Backbone.js, Ext JS, jQuery, server- and client-side logicless templates, Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Techniques: Kanban, rapid prototyping, continuous integration</p>

<h3>Analog Analytics (now Barclaycard) - Software Developer</h3>
<p><em>Jun 2011 - Mar 2012 · 10 mos</em></p>
<p>Analog Analytics was a start-up that developed a white-label platform for daily deals. I joined a mature team as an individual contributor. This was my first experience doing continuous delivery.

<h3>Collaborative Software Initiative - Software Developer, Lead role</h3>
<p><em>Jan 2008 - Jun 2011 · 3 yrs 6 mos</em></p>
<p>At CSI, I was the first full-time development hire, coming over from Liberty Mutual with my manager to build a new team and start work on a new project. We were to build an open source, disease surveillance application. Initially the application was for the public health department of the state of Utah, with the hope that a community would grow around it and be used by other health departments and the CDC. I worked closely with the VP of Engineering and Product to build out the development team that would work with the subject matter experts in Utah to accomplish these goals. In the first year, we built a highly effective team and replaced Utah's existing surveillance application. In the years that followed, we continued to iterate, growing the application into a powerful tool in the fight to prevent disease.</p>
<p>Technologies: Ruby on Rails</p>
<p>Techniques: Distributed agile, continuous integration, open-source devlopment/community maintenance</p>
<p>Successes: Building a great team and product that did some good for the world</p>

<div class="section" id="liberty-mutual-software-developer-technologist">
<h3>Liberty Mutual - Software Developer, Technologist</h3>
<p><em>Jul 2005 - Jan 2008 · 2 yrs 7 mos</em></p>
<p>I started at Liberty Mutual in Portland when IT was still under Liberty Northwest. In those days, I was an individual contributor on a web-based, auto-insurance application whose backend was a staged, event-driven system. I was developing services 'on the bus' and fixing scalability issues with the pre-existing ORM implementation.</p>
<p>Eventually, Liberty Northwest IT was folded into Liberty Mutual, and I was asked to join a small team that reported directly into the CTO of Liberty's agency markets business unit. Our charter was to help establish the future application architecture for Liberty Mutual, bring agile and lean software development techniques to the rest of the company, and bring open-source software usage and development in the company mainstream.</p>
<p>On this new team I was involved in rapid prototyping, architectural spikes, and product evaluations. On any given day we could be called upon by the CTO to stop what we were doing to address some business inefficiency. We were also asked to take trips out to other parts of the organization to present on agile and lean development techniques.</p>
<p>Technologies: Java, Ruby on Rails, Adobe Flex, JavaSpaces, Spring, Hibernate, ESB, SonicMQ</p>
<p>Techniques: Test-driven development, lean, agile</p>
<p>Successes: On the Liberty Northwest team, a re-write of an ORM implementation drastically improved performance of a key system. On the Liberty Mutual team, one of our greatest successes was to help stop a major project that was failing.</p>
